Color Match: A Machine Learning Tool for Finding the Perfect Outfit

A machine learning project I made for color-matching clothes.
The score is given by the dragons (a reference to an Israeli fashion review TV show), And it provides the user with a better outfit match: one for the shirt and one for the pants. 
The project was made as part of the course: Machine Learning as a Tool for Interactive Products at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
